# Note on env list when using molecule docker driver:

#   ref: https://github.com/philpep/testinfra/issues/197
# - when using molecule_* ansible filter plugin, it require
#   ansible and molecule in the same pyenv, so we
#   need install molecule in pyenv but remove its entry script.
#   this works for py36
# - for py26, molecule_* ansible filter plugin has syntax error,
#   so we can't use py26-ansible* at all.
